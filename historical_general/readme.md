# General historical files

This folder is intended for all sorts of historical sprites and sprite-related stuff.

My personal preference is to append the year in which something was added to the folder name. This way people will have at least some idea what epoch they're looking at.

Further details should be in the readme inside the folder itself, the folder names should be concise and uniform.
